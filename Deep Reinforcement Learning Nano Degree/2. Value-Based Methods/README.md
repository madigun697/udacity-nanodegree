# 2. Value-Based Methods

**Official course description**

*In the second part, you'll learn how to leverage neural networks when solving complex problems using the **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** algorithm.  You will also learn about modifications such as **double Q-learning**, **prioritized experience replay**, and **dueling networks**. Then, you'll use what youâ€™ve learned to create an artificially intelligent game-playing agent that can navigate a spaceship!*

*Use the DQN algorithm to train a spaceship to land safely on a planet.*

*You'll learn from experts at NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute how to apply your new skills to robotics applications.  Using a [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) simulation, you will train a rover to navigate an environment without running into walls.*

*You'll also get the **first project**, where you'll write an algorithm that teaches an agent to navigate a large world.*

*In Project 1, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.*

*All of the projects in this Nanodegree program use the rich simulation environments from the [Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/09/19/introducing-unity-machine-learning-agents/) software development kit (SDK).  You will learn more about ML-Agents in the next concept.*

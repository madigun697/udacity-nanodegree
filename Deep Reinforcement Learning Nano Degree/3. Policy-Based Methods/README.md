# 3. Policy-Based Methods

**Official course description**

*In the third part, you'll learn about policy-based and actor-critic methods such as **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**, and **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)**.  Youâ€™ll also learn about optimization techniques such as **evolution strategies** and **hill climbing**.*

*Use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to train a robot to walk.*

*You'll learn from experts at NVIDIA about the active research that they are  doing, to determine how to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques  to finance.  In particular, you'll explore an algorithm for optimal  execution of portfolio transactions.*

*You'll also get the **second project**, where you'll write an algorithm to train a robotic arm to reach moving target positions.*

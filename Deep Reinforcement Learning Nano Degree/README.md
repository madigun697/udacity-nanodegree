# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

## Certificate

## Program outline:

Learn cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”from Deep  Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). Apply  these concepts to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex  tasks, and build a robust portfolio of deep reinforcement learning  projects.

## 1. Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

Master the fundamentals of reinforcement learning by writing your own implementations of many classical solution methods.

## 2. Value-Based Methods

Apply deep learning architectures to reinforcement learning tasks. Train your own agent that navigates a virtual world from sensory data.

- Project: Navigation

## 3. Policy-Based Methods

Learn the theory behind evolutionary algorithms and policy-gradient  methods. Design your own algorithm to train a simulated robotic arm to  reach target locations.

- Project: Continuous Control

## 4. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Learn how to apply reinforcement learning methods to applications that  involve multiple, interacting agents. These techniques are used in a  variety of applications, such as the coordination of autonomous  vehicles.

- Project: Collaboration and Competition

# [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

## Certificate

## Program outline:

Learn cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”from Deep  Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). Apply  these concepts to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex  tasks, and build a robust portfolio of deep reinforcement learning  projects.

## [1. Foundations of Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/1.%20Foundations%20of%20Reinforcement%20Learning)

Master the fundamentals of reinforcement learning by writing your own implementations of many classical solution methods.

## [2. Value-Based Methods](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/2.%20Value-Based%20Methods)

Apply deep learning architectures to reinforcement learning tasks. Train your own agent that navigates a virtual world from sensory data.

## [3. Policy-Based Methods](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/3.%20Policy-Based%20Methods)

Learn the theory behind evolutionary algorithms and policy-gradient  methods. Design your own algorithm to train a simulated robotic arm to  reach target locations.

- Project: Continuous Control

## [4. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/4.%20Multi-Agent%20Reinforcement%20Learning)

Learn how to apply reinforcement learning methods to applications that  involve multiple, interacting agents. These techniques are used in a  variety of applications, such as the coordination of autonomous  vehicles.

- Project: Collaboration and Competition

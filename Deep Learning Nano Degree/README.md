# Deep Learning Nanodegree

## [1. Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Learning)

Introduce yourself to deep learning by applying style transfer to your own  images, and gaining experience using development tools such as Anaconda  and Jupyter notebooks.

## [2. Neural Networks](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/2.%20Neural%20Networks)

Learn neural network basics, and build your first network with Python and  NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build  multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

## [3. Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/3.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)

Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images  (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in  them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image de-noising.

## [4. Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/4.%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks)

Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with  PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to  generate new text from TV scripts.

## [5. Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/5.%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks)

Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative  adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow,  the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

   - Project: [Generate Faces](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/5.%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks/Project%205.%20Generate%20faces)

## [6. Deploying a Model](https://github.com/madigun697/udacity-nanodegree/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20Nano%20Degree/6.%20Deploying%20a%20Model%20)

Train and deploy your own sentiment analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker.  Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new,  user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
